            <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a
                muscular, broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.
                It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a
                social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related
                females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The
                lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have
                been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not actively seek out and prey on humans.</p>
